# Burrows-Wheeler transformation and FM index

This repository contains code for Burrows-Wheeler transformation and FM Index that was implemented as part of the project asignment for Genome Informatics class by students of master studies at School of Elecrtical Engineering.

We have four files that contain necessary code for the main startup module - ```main.py```, Burrows-Wheeler transformation and Sufix Array - ```burrows_wheeler.py```, FM Index - ```fm_index.py``` and unit tests are located in ```test.py```.

## How to run

You can run this project with ```python main.py``` command that uses short string as test data, but if you want to use it with genome sequence of your own you can run it with ```python main.py path/to/file```.

## Test file

In the test file we have covered a test scenario for each function used in this project. Simply run it with ```python test.py```.
